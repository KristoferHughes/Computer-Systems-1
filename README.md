Files and assignments from a course on C/C++ language
Assignment 4 is a program that puts the user through 5 phases to answer and complete the program. 
The user must put the answers to each phase in manually or create a .txt file to automatically input their answers.
The .txt file within the folder automatically solves the program for the user, however to find the answers to each phase
I had to trace back code within the program compiler to reverse-engineer the solution, decode ciphers, and do rigorous 
over the course of 3-4 days.
